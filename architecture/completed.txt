This log tracks the work completed by the autonomous refactoring engine.

--- WORK COMPLETED ON 2025-06-23 ---
- Manually refactored the entire Flask application to use a professional "Application Factory" pattern.
- Separated concerns into a clean structure (config, views, routes, utils).
- Manually implemented and verified a stable, running version of the application with a placeholder for the 'Preview Breaks' feature.
- The application is now stable and ready for feature development.

"Sync Message" from last session:
Good morning. The application architecture is now stable. The 'Preview Breaks' feature is stubbed out and the front-end is connected to the `/breaks/preview` endpoint, but the endpoint currently returns dummy data.

Your next task is to implement the real audio analysis logic:
1.  Open the file: `app/utils/enhanced_audio_processor.py`.
2.  Modify the `analyze_audio_for_breaks` function.
3.  Inside this function, you must use the `pydub` library to load the audio file located at `audio_file_path`.
4.  Implement logic to detect periods of silence based on parameters that will be passed in the `settings` dictionary (e.g., `silence_thresh`, `min_silence_len`).
5.  The function must return a Python list of floating-point numbers, where each number is a timestamp (in seconds) representing the midpoint of a detected silence.
