# Podcast Pro Deployment Log - January 7, 2025

## Session Summary

### Issue 1: Cloud Run Service Returns 503 Error
**Status:** SOLVED
**Problem:** Service was failing to start with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cloud_sql_python_connector'`
**Root Cause:** Incorrect import statement in db_manager.py
**Solution:** Changed import from `from cloud_sql_python_connector import Connector` to `from google.cloud.sql.connector import Connector`
**Action Taken:** Fixed import locally, committed, and pushed to trigger redeployment

### Issue 2: Cloud SQL Instance Status
**Status:** SOLVED  
**Problem:** Initial check showed Cloud SQL instance as not found/not running
**Root Cause:** Instance was actually running in us-west1 (correct region)
**Solution:** Verified instance was running, updated Cloud Run service connection string
**Action Taken:** Ran fix_sql_region.sh to update service configuration

### Issue 3: Missing requirements.txt
**Status:** SOLVED (earlier in session)
**Problem:** Cloud Build was failing due to missing requirements.txt
**Root Cause:** File was not in repository
**Solution:** Created comprehensive requirements.txt with all necessary packages
**Action Taken:** Created file with correct package versions

## Current Status

- Service URL: https://podcast-pro-backend-krn46yggsq-uw.a.run.app
